# Crystal Echoes

Crystal Echoes is a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) Dungeons & Dragons 5e campaign setting. It's in super early development.

## Features

Crystal Echoes has nine material worlds, each with its own flavor. Game Masters can choose which world to set their campaign in without compromising or committing to a generic fantasy. Or: set the campaign in multiple worlds. And if that's not enough, you can always swap out the default nine material worlds from a library of others, or build your own. The choice is yours.

## Nine Material Worlds

The default material worlds include:

* Aulibarr - A high magic world where the majority of the populace lives in a giant nation-sized city. Outside the city the barriers between the ethereal plane and the plane of shadow have evaporated -- allowing powerful monsters to roam the world. Three continents dominate the surface.
* Sorav - A traditional D&D world set on a Pangaea continent, with exotic surrounding islands. Beware of dragons!
* Suiru - Ahoy! A water world covered in archipeligos and dominated by sea-faring folk. Pirates, Privateers, Merfolk, Marines and all sorts of dangerous adventures await you on the Thirteen Oceans!

* Regiel - A dark world with low magic, little hope, and constant war. The souls of the dead are often blocked from entering the Outer Planes, and cause an incredible problem with the undead. Prayers go unanswered, magic fails, and the even the best heroes crumble in the onslaught.
* Renda - An extreme world of constant storms, earthquakes, erupting volcanoes, tortuous deserts, and wild magic. Landmasses are formed and destroyed in months instead of millinea. Only the most dangerous monsters, brave adventurers, and the crazy ever go here.

## Builds

Not yet, but we'll be using [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html)! We'll probably want to build a pdf, epub, and html format, at least. We'll be using [pandoc 1.13.1+](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/1.13.1)
